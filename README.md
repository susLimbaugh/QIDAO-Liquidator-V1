# QIDAO-Liquidator-V1
A liquidator script for the QIDAO protocol on the Polygon network.

To use this script, you will need to setup a Python3 environment on your own. You will also need to do a pip install web3, along with adding an RPC endpoint as URL variable, your address as myAddress variable, and you private key as priv variable. This is version 1 of the liquidator script and as such is quite slow. It will rarely beat out other liquidation bots, but if you're holding $MAI in your wallet and run one of these, you have a chance at buying some discounted $MATIC on a dip.
